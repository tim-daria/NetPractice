# NetPractice

This project was created by **dtimofee** as part of the 42 curriculum.

## 📝 Description

**NetPractice** is a project designed to introduce core networking fundamentals through hands-on practice. This project focuses on understanding, analyzing, and configuring network infrastructures and does not involve writing code.

The main goal of NetPractice is to help understand how data travels across networks by working with concepts like IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and network communication rules.
The project consists of several levels, each representing a different network topology that must be correctly configured to allow communication between hosts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Instructions

1. Download the archive `net_practice.1.8.tgz` from the project page in Intra.
2. Unpack the archive (e.g. by double-clicking on it in Finder in Mac OS).
3. Open the NetPractice training interface by opening `index.html` in a web browser.
4. The interface presents a series of levels, each with a predefined network topology.
5. For each level:
    -   Analyze the network topology.
    -   Configure IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and routes as required.
    -   Validate the configuration using the interface's tools.
6. Once a level is successfully validated, export the configuration file.

## Submission Requirements

-   All 10 levels must be completed and validated.
-   This `README.md` file must be at the root of the repository.
-   The repository root must also include the 10 exported configuration files, one for each level.

## Use of AI

AI tools were used for the following purposes:
-   To help structure and format the `README.md` file.
-   To clarify networking concepts and terminology.
